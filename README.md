# Crown-Guess-and-Selection
--We propose a new "crown guess and selection" framework for detecting individual trees from ALS Point Clouds. The framework provides a new way to cooperate geometric priorities and topological relationships among trees simultaneously.This framework offers a novel perspective on the ITD (Individual Tree Detection) problem.

--The relevant code will be updated in this project after the paper is published. We also plan to integrate the algorithm into Point Cloud Magic (a easy-to-use pointcloud
processing software, http://www.lidarcas.cn/soft/detail?id=9 (in Chinese)) as a data processing plug-in module, and this can benefit forest inventory tasks.
